Question 10 [12 Marks]
Give the implementation of a function called bothMinAndMax that computes both the minimum
and maximum values of three integer parameters x, y, and z, and returns the minimum and
maximum values via the pointer parameters minPtr and maxPtr.
Note 1: you must also add a proper call to bothMinAndMax in the main function below, in the
position indicated, such that bothMinAndMax will modify smallest to contain the minimum of
a, b, and c, and will modify largest to contain the maximum of a, b, and c.
For the values of a, b, and c given below, main will print: Of 7, 5, and 9, 5 is the
smallest and 9 is the largest.
Note 2: your implementation of bothMinAndMax should work for any input values of x, y, and
z, not just the example values given below.
Note 3: when two variables have the same value, you can return either one; e.g., if x has the same
value as y, and both are less than z, you can return either x or y as the minimum value.


Question 11 [12 Marks]
Write a complete C program that guesses a user’s secret number, denoted by s, by successively
prompting the user to answer yes/no questions that narrow the range of possible values for the
secret number. The program first prompts the user to enter a range of values [min, max] such that
min ≤ s ≤ max. The program starts by asking the user
“Is your secret number greater than min +(max − mi
n)/2?”
If the user answers “yes”, then we know that the user’s secret number lies in the range [min + max − min
2 +
1, max]; otherwise the number lies in [min, min + max − min
2
]. Therefore, after each round of questioning,
the values of min and max are further refined (the range of values is divided by half).
The program continues to ask the question (after refining the min and max values based on user’s
response) until the value of min is equal to max. When the value of min = max, then the program
has found the user’s secret number, which is equal to s = min = max, and the program prints
user’s secret value and terminates.
Assume all user inputs including user’s secret numbers are valid integers and min ≤ max. Also
assume that the user enters “1” for “yes” and “0” for “no”.

Question 12 [12 Marks]
Write a complete C program that performs the following tasks.
• Asks the user for a non-zero positive integer and stores it in the variable num;
• Prints the numbers between 1 and num (inclusive), but
– For multiples of three prints “Bizz” instead of the number.
– For multples of five prints “Buzz” instead of the number.
– For multiples of both three and five prints “BizzBuzz” instead of the number.
• prints the sum of all the numbers between 1 and num not including Bizz, Buzz, and BizzBuzz
(i.e., the sum of all the non-Bizz, non-Buzz and non-BizzBuzz numbers).
You can assume that the user provides the correct input, a positive integer that fits within the
range of an int variable (i.e. You do not have to explicitly check the sign and range of the integer).
You are not allowed to use any other header file other than stdio.h. The following is an
example run of the program with the data entered by the user displayed in bold font
